How do I approach designing software?
I approach desinging software with an open and non-baised mindset. 
It is important to be willing to learn as you program and take feedback. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

The new design skills that I learned through my work in this project are as follows:
I learned how to craft shapes in a 3D setting, and also adding textures on shapes in a 3D environment. It was useful to understand how to apply these. 
They helped bring my scene to look more realistic. Lighting was interesting to learn too. I was able to use it to cast atmosphere into my scene. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a design process of integration, by adding little by little as I went. I then would test each part of the code before moving on. It was a structural approach to the projects. I made sure to reference back on all learning material and videos. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tatics I used from my design can help me in my future work by allowing me to manage bigger projects by cutting them into small objectives. I learned to tackle what I could and not be overwhelmed which is benenfical for employeers to see a rational and calm plan. The knowledge of allowing myself to reference back and understand the material given is benefical too. 

How do I approach developing programs?
As I spoke on it before taking my project and implementing it into small portions for an overall solution is an approach to developing program that I used. Iteration was a huge part of my developmental process and helped me to test and debug the issues in my program. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My apporach became more cevolved throughout the milestones which led to my completion. I was able to grap the concepts given to me without having to stop every line of code and reference back. I became more comfident in my work and skills as I engaged with the coursework. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science will help me reach my goald by providnig me the knowledge and skills needed to suceed in this field. It helped me learn to problem solve myself and not give up with the first failures. My comprehension skills with visual objects. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualixations give me new knowledge and skills I can apply in my future educational pathway by allowing me to understand all the complex concepts of Computer science. Computational graphics and visualizations give can give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway by giving me the skills such as being able to interact with 3D visualizations, and environments. I could apply these skills with data science and visual content development.
